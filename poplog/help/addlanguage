addlanguage( assoc-list );

This package provides a friendly interface to the subsystem capabilities of
Poplog.  It allows you to add a new programming language to Poplog with
relative ease.

The argument to addlanguage consists of an association list (see * ASSOC)
with the following fields in any order.  Some fields are optional.

[
    [name               <word for subsystem>]
    [compiler           <compiler for language>]
    [top_level_name     <word for top-level subsystem>] ;;; optional
    [top_level_compiler <compiler for top-level>]       ;;; optional
    [file_ext           <file extension for VED, string incl the '.' prefix>]
    [prompt             <prompt for new language, string>]      ;;; optional
    [reset              <procedure to run on setpop>]   ;;; optional
]

Note that some languages (eg. Prolog) are best defined in terms of an
top-level, interactive mode and a compilation mode.  The addlanguage
capability caters for this by allowing you to specify two compilers, one for
each mode.  This means that immediate mode will use the top-level mode
and ved_lmr will use the compilation mode.
