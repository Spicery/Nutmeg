# Nutmeg
A language that [kicks the ball between the legs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg_(association_football)) of [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) programming

**PLEASE NOTE: Nutmeg is a work in progress. It is not ready for use and documentation has hardly started. But if you are interested in contributing please contact the devs :) We got a fair way along & then got disgruntle by .NET and Python for various complicated reasons. We're now rewriting in Java, for more complicated reasons. Please bear with :) **
